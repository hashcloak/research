<br>Given a polynomial commitment schemes from groups of unknown order,instantitate this with class groups, then will  get transparent setup 
and  a few other nice properties . Apply it with Sonic, then will result in something called SuperSonic.
It's a trustless setup SNARK with *log(n)* proof size and *log(n)* verification, quasi-linear prover time + preprocessing, 
as well as 24 kb proof size for 1 million gate circuits.

<big>**Thoughts**<big>  
  
Three flavours of general-purpose snarks:    
- Powers of tau  
  generating and safely disposing of toxic waste 
  used by [Sonic](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/099.pdf) and [PLONK](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/953.pdf)  
- FRI-based 
  [STARKs by STARKWARE](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/046.pdf)  
- RSA or class group

Trade-offs between different options:  
- With *updatable* universal setups:  
  [Sonic](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/099.pdf)  
  
- With *non-updatable* universal setups:

  [Hyrax](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1132.pdf)

- With transparent setups:  
  [Fractal](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1076.pdf),
  [Halo](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1021.pdf),
  [Supersonic](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1229.pdf),
  [Spartan](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/550.pdf),  
  Adcantages : Relies on common reference string, public ,no toxic waste.  
  Disadvantages : big proof size .  
- Performance:  
  prover time and verifier time  
  
  
Universality for a polynomial commitment scheme :   
- language-specific: a polynomial commitment only proves one language


Discussion of universal succintness:
-   __[universal arguments,page 27](https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/580.pdf)__  
    \- needs future improments.  


Definition of soundness:  
-   __standard definition of special soundness：Interact arbitrarily with an update oracle to set the SRS __  
-   __[interactive definition by Sonic,page 5](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/099.pdf)__
    \- given an initial one and update in one-shot fashion.  
Discussion of security models and hardness assumptions :
-   __[updatable knowledge soundness,page 22](https://smeiklej.com/files/crypto18.pdf)__  
-   __[KEA assumptions,page 18](https://smeiklej.com/files/crypto18.pdf)__  

Discussion of security and efficiency:  
-   __[Proof of security,page 23](https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/580.pdf)__  
    \- construct circuits of extraction,then prove it with satisfied properties.  
       enhance efficiency by applying "universal succintness".
